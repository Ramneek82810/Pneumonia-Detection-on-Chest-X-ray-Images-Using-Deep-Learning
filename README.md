Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung that affects the small air sacs known as alveoli. 🫁🔥 It typically includes symptoms such as dry cough, chest pain, fever, and difficulty breathing. 😷💨 The severity of the condition varies from person to person.

Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria 🦠🦠, and less commonly by conditions such as other micro-organisms, certain medications 💊, or auto-immune diseases. ⚡🦠

## Risk factors include:

-Cystic fibrosis 🧬

-Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) 💨

-Asthma 🌬️

-Diabetes 🍩

-Heart failure ❤️

-Smoking history 🚬

-Poor ability to cough after smoke ☁️

-A weak immune system 🦠🛡️

Diagnosis is usually based on symptoms and physical examination. 👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️ A chest X-ray 🩻, blood tests 🩸, and sputum culture 🧪 can help confirm the diagnosis.

## CNN (Convolutional Neural Network):
CNN stands for Convolutional Neural Network 🤖, which is a specialized neural network for processing data that has an input shape like a 2D matrix, such as an image 🖼️. CNNs are typically used for image detection 🔍 and classification 🏷️.

The normal chest X-ray (left panel) depicts clear lungs without any areas of abnormal opacification in the image. 🫁✅

Bacterial pneumonia (middle panel) typically exhibits a focal lobar consolidation, in this case in the right upper lobe (white arrows) 🦠➡️🩻.

Viral pneumonia (right panel) manifests with a more diffuse "interstitial" pattern in both lungs 🌬️🌫️

## Content

The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders of each image category (Pneumonia / Normal) 🗂️🩻. There are 5,863 X-ray images (JPEG) 📸 and 2 categories (Pneumonia / Normal). 🏥

Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients (ages 1 to 5 years old) from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou 🌍👶. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients' routine clinical care. 💉🩺

For the analysis of chest X-ray images, all radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low-quality or unreadable scans 🧐📊. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians 👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️ before being cleared for training the AI system 🤖💡. To account for any grading errors, the evaluation set was also checked by a third expert 👨‍⚕️🔍.
