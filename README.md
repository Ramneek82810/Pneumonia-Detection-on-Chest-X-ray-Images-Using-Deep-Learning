Pneumonia is a inflammatory condition of the lung that affects the small air sacs known as alveoli. It typically includes symptoms such as dry cough, chest pain, fever and difficulty breathing. The severity of the condition varies from person to person.

Pneumonia is usually causedd by infection with viruses or bacteria, and less commonly by conditions such as other micro-organisms, certain medications or auto-immune diseases

Risk factors include cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), asthma, diabetes, heart failure, smoking history, poor ability to cough after smoke, and a weak immune system.

Diagnosis is usually based on symptoms and physical examination. A chest X-ray, blood tests, and sputum culture can help confirm the diagnosis


## CNN (Convolutional Neural Network):
CNN stands for Convolutional Neural Network which is specialized neural network for processing data that has an input shape like a 2D matrix like image. CNN's are typically used for image detection and classification.

The normal chest X-ray(left panel) depicts clear lungs without any areas of abnormal opacification in the image. Bacterical pneumonia (middle panel) typically exhibits a focal lobar consolidation, in this case in the right upper lobe (white arrows), whereas viral pneumonia(right panel) manifets with a more diffuse "interstitial" pattern in both lungs.

##Content
The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders of each image category (Pneumonia / Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories(Pneumonia/Normal)

Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care.

For the analysis of chest x-ray images, all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low quality or unreadable scans. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians before being cleared for training the AI system. In order to account for any grading errors, the evaluation set was also checked by a third expert.
